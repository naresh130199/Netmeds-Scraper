    "faqs": "FAQs ABOUT CAPNEA SOLUTION  Q: What is the use of CAPNEA SOLUTION?  A: CAPNEA SOLUTION is used to treat primary apnea (episodes of interrupted breathing) in premature babies. It can also be used to treat and prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (airway damage) among premature babies.  Q: How CAPNEA SOLUTION helps in breathing problems?  A: CAPNEA SOLUTION is a CNS stimulant. It works by stimulating a part of the brain that controls breathing. As a result, the brain transfers a lot of breathing signals to the lungs which makes the lungs breathe more deeper and faster. It also increases the number of breathing cycles, prevents the airway damage and reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.  Q: Is CAPNEA SOLUTION safe for use in children?  A: CAPNEA SOLUTION can be used in premature infants born between 28-33 gestation weeks (7-8 months of pregnancy) under careful medical supervision.  Q: Why newborn babies suffer from apnea?  A: Primary apnea in premature babies happens due to immature development of baby’s breathing centers.  Q:  What are the side effects of CAPNEA SOLUTION?  A: The most common side effect of CAPNEA SOLUTION is fast or irregular heart rate. Consult your doctor if it worsens.  Q: Is CAPNEA SOLUTION effective?  A: CAPNEA SOLUTION effectively improves breathing among infants suffering from apnea of prematurity. It works by stimulating a part of the brain that controls breathing. It also increases the number of breathing cycles, prevents the airway damage and reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.",

Cerebroprotein hydrolysate is a neurotrophic agent which works by protecting the nerve cells from toxins and lack of oxygen thus improving its survival rate. It also helps in the formation of new nerve cells by increasing nutrition supply to the brain cells and reducing the inflammatory reaction of the brain tissues which results in preventing damage to the brain cells.  COGNISTAR 30MG is not recommended for use in patients with severe kidney dysfunction, status epilepticus (life threatening neurological disorder), and or major epilepsia (seizure that causes loss of consciousness).

It is used to treat traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Cerebroprotein hydrolysate is a unique drug with small neurological peptides produced by standardized enzymatic breakdown of lipid-free porcine brain proteins. It contains numerous neurotrophic factors which enhances neurogenesis, neuronal survival, neuromodulatory action, neuronal repair and has neuroimmunotrophic actions. It reduces excitotoxic damage and offers protection against ischemic and neurotoxic lesions.  Take this medicine as directed by your physician. Your doctor will decide the correct dose and duration for you depending upon your condition. Do not take this medicine, if you have any pre-existing epileptic conditions such as status epilepticus or grand mal seizure, as this medicine may increase the frequency of seizure attacks. Before taking this medicine, inform your doctor if you have any renal insufficiency or renal dysfunction. COGNIZA should be used in pregnant or breastfeeding women only if it is clearly necessary due to lack of data on human study.

    "faqs": "FAQs ABOUT A RET 0.025% GEL Q: Can the use of A RET 0.025% GEL cure wrinkles?  A: A RET 0.025% GEL contains tretinoin, which is a derivative of vitamin A and is commonly used for various skin conditions, including acne and photoaging (skin aging caused by sun exposure). Tretinoin is known for its ability to stimulate collagen production and promote skin cell turnover, which can lead to improvements in skin texture and appearance. For wrinkles, tretinoin can be effective in reducing fine lines and improving skin elasticity. It works by increasing cell turnover and promoting the production of collagen, which can help to smooth out wrinkles over time. However, it does not completely cure wrinkles.  Q: How long does it take for A RET 0.025% GEL to show results?  A: Results from A RET 0.025% GEL, containing tretinoin, vary among individuals. Generally, noticeable improvements in skin texture and wrinkle reduction may take several weeks to months. In the initial 2-4 weeks, users may experience skin adjustment, potentially including redness or flakiness. Over the first 2-3 months, fine lines may begin to diminish as collagen production increases. Long-term and consistent use (3-6 months and beyond) is often necessary for the most significant improvements. Following dermatologist instructions and using sunscreen is crucial due to increased skin sensitivity. Individual responses differ, so patience is essential, and any concerns should be addressed with a dermatologist.  Q: Can A RET 0.025% GEL remove dark spots?  A: A RET 0.025% GEL containing tretinoin, can help reduce the appearance of dark spots by promoting skin cell turnover and inhibiting melanin production. While it may not completely cure dark spots, consistent and long-term use, along with sun protection, can lead to noticeable improvements. For a comprehensive approach, consulting with a dermatologist is recommended.  Q: Can I use A RET 0.025% GEL daily?  A: A RET 0.025% GEL should be used under careful medical supervision. Your doctor might recommend you to consistently use this medicine for a longer period of time to achieve best results.

Acne is a common skin condition characterized by the presence of pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, and inflammation, often caused by clogged hair follicles and the overproduction of oil. It is primarily caused by a combination of factors, including excess oil production, clogged hair follicles, bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes), and inflammation. Hormonal changes, genetics, certain medications, and lifestyle factors can also contribute to the development of acne.  Q: What precautions should I take while using A RET 0.025% GEL?  A: Do not use A RET 0.025% GEL on sunburned skin, cuts, scrapes, eczema or damaged skin. Practice good skin care and avoid exposure to sunlight as you may get sunburned more easily.

    "faqs": "FAQs ABOUT A RET 0.1% GEL Q: Can the use of A RET 0.1% GEL cure wrinkles?  A: A RET 0.1% GEL contains tretinoin, which is a derivative of vitamin A and is commonly used for various skin conditions, including acne and photoaging (skin aging caused by sun exposure). Tretinoin is known for its ability to stimulate collagen production and promote skin cell turnover, which can lead to improvements in skin texture and appearance. For wrinkles, tretinoin can be effective in reducing fine lines and improving skin elasticity. It works by increasing cell turnover and promoting the production of collagen, which can help to smooth out wrinkles over time. However, it does not completely cure wrinkles.  Q: How long does it take for A RET 0.1% GEL to show results?  A: Results from A RET 0.1% GEL, containing tretinoin, vary among individuals. Generally, noticeable improvements in skin texture and wrinkle reduction may take several weeks to months. In the initial 2-4 weeks, users may experience skin adjustment, potentially including redness or flakiness. Over the first 2-3 months, fine lines may begin to diminish as collagen production increases. Long-term and consistent use (3-6 months and beyond) is often necessary for the most significant improvements. Following dermatologist instructions and using sunscreen is crucial due to increased skin sensitivity. Individual responses differ, so patience is essential, and any concerns should be addressed with a dermatologist.  Q: Can A RET 0.1% GEL remove dark spots?  A: A RET 0.1% GEL containing tretinoin, can help reduce the appearance of dark spots by promoting skin cell turnover and inhibiting melanin production. While it may not completely cure dark spots, consistent and long-term use, along with sun protection, can lead to noticeable improvements. For a comprehensive approach, consulting with a dermatologist is recommended.  Q: Can I use A RET 0.1% GEL daily?  A: A RET 0.1% GEL should be used under careful medical supervision. Your doctor might recommend you to consistently use this medicine for a longer period of time to achieve best results. Following dermatologist instructions and using sunscreen is crucial due to increased skin sensitivity. It is important to stay with patience to notice results and if any concerns arise, kindly consult your doctor.  Q: Does retinol brighten your skin?  Yes, retinol is a vitamin A derivative with powerful antioxidant properties. It can contribute to skin brightening by promoting cell turnover and reducing hyperpigmentation, resulting in a more even complexion.  Q: What is acne?  Acne is a common skin condition characterized by the presence of pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, and inflammation, often caused by clogged hair follicles and the overproduction of oil. It is primarily caused by a combination of factors, including excess oil production, clogged hair follicles, bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes), and inflammation. Hormonal changes, genetics, certain medications, and lifestyle factors can also contribute to the development of acne.  Q: What precautions should I take while using A RET 0.1% GEL?  A: Do not use A RET 0.1% GEL on sunburned skin, cuts, scrapes, eczema or damaged skin. Practice good skin care and avoid exposure to sunlight as you may get sunburned more easily.

Q: Can I use makeup during treatment with A RET 0.1% GEL?  A: While using A RET 0.1% GEL, it is advisable to be cautious with makeup application, especially during the initial stages of treatment as the tretinoin present in the medicine can make your skin more sensitive and prone to irritation.  Q: Can I use other skin preparations with A RET 0.1% GEL?  A: Do not use any other skin preparations with A RET 0.1% GEL without asking your doctor.

A: Dry skin especially on your nose and lips is a prevalent side effect of using A RET 0.1% GEL. It happens because the tretinoin present in the medicine reduces sebum secretion on your skin. To combat this, keep yourself hydrated by drinking plenty of water and fluids, Apply a moisturizer and lip balm that suits your skin as advised by your physician.  Q. Is A RET 0.1% GEL safe?

    "about": "INTRODUCTION  ACNEDAP PLUS contains a combination of Adapalene and Dapsone, which belongs to the group of medicines called topical retinoids and sulfonamide antibiotics. It is used in the treatment of skin acne. Acne is a condition of the skin when the root of your hair (hair follicle) or skin pores gets clogged by oil or dead skin, which becomes prone to bacterial infection resulting in pimples, blackheads and spots or scars.  Adapalene is a form of vitamin A (retinoid) that acts as an antiacne agent by binding directly to the receptors of the skin which increases the rate of cell regeneration and decreases oil secretion preventing clogging of the hair follicles and pores. It also reduces swelling and inflammation. Dapsone is an antibiotic with a structure similar to PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) that kills bacteria by competitively substituting PABA, a nutrient that bacteria use to generate folic acid for growth and survival. Before recommending ACNEDAP PLUS, your doctor may advise you to have tests to understand your existing condition for planning effective treatment methods. Stay well hydrated and protect your skin from exposure to sunlight or UV light.  Do not apply ACNEDAP PLUS if you are allergic to adapalene or dapsone or have bruises, cuts or burns on the skin, It should be used with caution and inform your doctor if have any disorder of the digestive system (colitis), a disorder of the immune system, anemia or G6PD deficiency.

    "about": "INTRODUCTION  ACNE B is a combination of Clindamycin and Benzoyl peroxide which belongs to the group of medicines called Anti-acne preparations. It is used in the treatment of mild to moderate acne in adults and in adolescents (aged 12 years or older).  Acne is a common skin problem caused due to clogging off skin pores with dead skin cells or sebum (oil produced by the skin) with or without bacterial infection. It makes the skin inflamed with redness and pustules, along with small bumps on the skin which may be whiteheads or blackheads.  Clindamycin is a topical antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial agent with sebum controlling properties. Both clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide acts by stopping the growth and multiplication of the acne-causing bacteria. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide can remove the accumulated dead skin cells and excess oil from the skin pores that triggers acne breakouts.  Use ACNE B as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid using ACNE B on inflamed, irritated, or sensitive skin areas. ACNE B may bleach your clothes, therefore avoid the contact of ACNE B with coloured fabrics.  Before using ACNE B inform your doctor if you have recently used any medicine that contains clindamycin or erythromycin.

    "about": "INTRODUCTION  ACNESOL A NANO GEL contains a combination of Adapalene and Clindamycin, which belongs to the group of medicines called topical retinoids and lincomycin antibiotics. It is used in the treatment of skin acne (pimple). Acne is a condition of the skin when the root of your hair (hair follicle) or skin pores gets clogged by oil or dead skin, which becomes prone to bacterial infection and the formation of pimples, blackheads, spots and scars.  Adapalene is a form of vitamin A, that acts as an antiacne agent by binding directly to the receptor of the skin which increases the rate of cell turnover (cell regeneration) and decreases oil secretion preventing clogging of the hair follicles and pores, also decreasing swelling/inflammation. Clindamycin works by binding to the ribosomal unit of the bacteria and disrupts the production of the protein essential for its survival. Before recommending ACNESOL A NANO GEL, your doctor may advise you to have tests to understand your existing condition for planning effective treatment methods. Stay well hydrated and protect your skin from exposure to sunlight or UV light.  Do not apply ACNESOL A NANO GEL if you are allergic to adapalene or clindamycin, a disorder of the digestive system (colitis), a disorder of the immune system or have bruises, cuts or burns on the skin.

It is used in the treatment of skin acne (pimple). Acne is a condition of the skin when the root of your hair (hair follicle) or skin pores gets clogged by oil or dead skin, which becomes prone to bacterial infection and the formation of pimples, blackheads, spots and scars.  Adapalene is a form of vitamin A, that acts as an antiacne agent by binding directly to the receptor of the skin which increases the rate of cell turnover (cell regeneration) and decreases oil secretion preventing clogging of the hair follicles and pores, also decreasing swelling/inflammation. Clindamycin works by binding to the ribosomal unit of the bacteria and disrupts the production of the protein essential for its survival. Before recommending ACNETOR AD, your doctor may advise you to have tests to understand your existing condition for planning effective treatment methods. Stay well hydrated and protect your skin from exposure to sunlight or UV light.

    "about": "INTRODUCTION  ACNEWAR PLUS contains a combination of Adapalene and Dapsone, which belongs to the group of medicines called topical retinoids and sulfonamide antibiotics. It is used in the treatment of skin acne. Acne is a condition of the skin when the root of your hair (hair follicle) or skin pores gets clogged by oil or dead skin, which becomes prone to bacterial infection resulting in pimples, blackheads and spots or scars.  Adapalene is a form of vitamin A (retinoid) that acts as an antiacne agent by binding directly to the receptors of the skin which increases the rate of cell regeneration and decreases oil secretion preventing clogging of the hair follicles and pores. It also reduces swelling and inflammation. Dapsone is an antibiotic with a structure similar to PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) that kills bacteria by competitively substituting PABA, a nutrient that bacteria use to generate folic acid for growth and survival. Before recommending ACNEWAR PLUS, your doctor may advise you to have tests to understand your existing condition for planning effective treatment methods. Stay well hydrated and protect your skin from exposure to sunlight or UV light.  Do not apply ACNEWAR PLUS if you are allergic to adapalene or dapsone or have bruises, cuts or burns on the skin, It should be used with caution and inform your doctor if have any disorder of the digestive system (colitis), a disorder of the immune system, anemia or G6PD deficiency.
