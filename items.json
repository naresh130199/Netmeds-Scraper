It is used to treat cranial injury (trauma to scalp, skull, and/or brain), inability to sustain concentration in dementia (group of disease or illness that affects your ability to think, memorize and reason), cerebrovascular disease that includes stroke (brain damage due to interruption of blood flow), and alzheimer's disease (progressive neurologic disorder that causes brain to shrink and brain cells to die).  Cerebroprotein hydrolysate is a neurotrophic agent which works by protecting the nerve cells from toxins and lack of oxygen thus improving its survival rate. It also helps in the formation of new nerve cells by increasing nutrition supply to the brain cells and reducing the inflammatory reaction of the brain tissues which results in preventing damage to the brain cells.  COGNISTAR 30MG is not recommended for use in patients with severe kidney dysfunction, status epilepticus (life threatening neurological disorder), and or major epilepsia (seizure that causes loss of consciousness). It should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (fits or seizures) and or allergic diathesis (condition that causes group of allergic reaction such as hay fever, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, or atopic dermatitis).  COGNISTAR 30MG should be used with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women only if it is clearly advised by your doctor. It should be used with caution in elderly patients (above 65 years).
